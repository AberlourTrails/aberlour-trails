                        Dr Thomas Alexander Sellar (1856-1950), born in Lhanbryde, Moray, built Dunleigh as the family home and medical surgery on Queens Road in 1882. The outbuildings originally contained a stable and a hay loft, accommodation for a groom and a coal cellar.

                    <p>
                        Dr Sellar served as medical doctor for Aberlour and community for 44 years up until his retirement in 1928. He made home visits throughout a huge rural area of 200 square miles by foot, bicycle, horse (sometimes with cart), and later by motor car.

                    <p>
                        Dr Beatrice Mary Sellar (1898-1985) was the youngest child of Dr TA Sellar. She returned from London to study Medicine at the University of Aberdeen and joined her father‚Äôs practice in 1923, going on to serve the community for 38 years. Her commitment involved many trips undertaken in wild weather by foot, by motorbike and later by car.

                        Dunleigh was the family home for three generations of Sellars and Caldwells as well as the doctors' surgery before the present Aberlour Health Centre was built in 1971 attached to the Fleming Hospital. In total, the Sellar/Caldwell dynasty contributed to the greater welfare of Aberlour and District for over a century.

                        Dunleigh remained in the Sellar and Caldwell families up until its sale in 2017.
